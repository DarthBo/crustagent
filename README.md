# crustagent

Use classic **Microsoft Agent** characters — *Clippy, Merlin, Genie, Peedy, Robby* — in
modern, cross-platform apps, from safe **Rust**.

crustagent reads the original `.acs` character files (and, over time, `.acf`/`.acd`) and
gives you their palettes, animations, frames, sounds and speech markup as clean Rust
types — plus a portable runtime to sequence and play them. No Windows, no COM, no SAPI, no
DirectShow. The aim isn't to re-clone the old desktop assistant wholesale; it's to make
these lovingly-made characters usable again wherever Rust runs.

## Lineage

- **Microsoft Agent** (late-'90s/early-2000s) is the OG — the technology and the `.acs`
  format we target.
- **[DoubleAgent](https://sourceforge.net/projects/doubleagent/)** (Cinnamon Software) is a
  faithful open-source Windows/C++ reimplementation. We used its source as the reference
  for reverse-engineering the byte formats and playback behavior — huge thanks to it.
- **crustagent** is a from-scratch, platform-independent Rust take: a reimplementation of a
  reimplementation, aimed at modern apps rather than at reproducing every Windows detail.

## Workspace layout

```
crates/
  crustagent/          # embedding API: Agent + serial action queue (start here to embed)
  crustagent-format/   # pure parsers for the character file formats (ACS 2.0, ACF header)
  crustagent-core/     # portable runtime: sequencing, idle, motion, balloon layout, text
  crustagent-tts/      # pluggable text-to-speech: VoiceEvent stream + TimedTts/SystemTts
  crustagent-gif/      # dependency-free animated GIF89a encoder (round-trip tested)
  crustagent-render/   # viewer: tight character window + separate balloon window
```

The viewer uses two windows, MS-Agent-style: a **tight, non-resizable character window**
and a **separate balloon window** that appears above the character (or below, near the
screen top) while it speaks. Both are transparent, borderless, and always-on-top (`wgpu`).

### Embed it

```rust
use crustagent::Agent;
let mut agent = Agent::load("Merlin.acs")?;
agent.show();
agent.speak("Hello there!");
agent.play("Wave");
agent.move_to(400, 200, 300);
loop {
    agent.update(dt_ms);                       // advance by elapsed time
    if let Some(frame) = agent.composite_current() { /* blit frame.pixels (RGBA) */ }
    if let Some(b) = agent.balloon() { /* draw b.layout.lines */ }
}
```

The `Agent` runs a serial action queue (`show`/`hide`/`play`/`speak`/`move_to`/
`gesture_at`/`wait`), auto-idles when the queue drains, and hands back a composited RGBA
frame + balloon + position each tick — windowing- and audio-agnostic.

Speech goes through a pluggable `TtsEngine` (`crustagent-tts`): the default `TimedTts` is
silent and paces the balloon/mouth on a timer, while `SystemTts` plays real audio on
Windows/macOS/Linux via the [`tts`](https://crates.io/crates/tts) crate (WinRT/SAPI,
AVSpeech, speech-dispatcher). Engines emit a `VoiceEvent` stream (word boundaries →
balloon reveal, visemes → mouth) that the `Agent` consumes each tick. (Linux needs
`speech-dispatcher` installed for audio; it degrades to silent otherwise.)

Planned: a viseme-accurate/offline TTS backend (e.g. Piper) for true lip-sync, `.aca`
bodies for ACF + the ACS 1.5 (OLE2) format, and a host-defined command API for the menu.

## `crustagent-format` — status

Implemented:
- **ACS 2.0** (`AcsFile`) — the compiled binary format: header, palette, TTS/balloon
  metadata, names (with language preference), states, gestures→animations→frames
  (images, overlays, branching), the LZ77 image bitstream **decompressor**, raw WAV
  sound extraction, and a **frame compositor** to RGBA/indexed.

Not yet (nice-to-have): ACS 1.5 (OLE2 compound document), ACF (+ external `.aca`), ACD
(text script).

## `crustagent-core` — status

Implemented:
- **Sequence builder** (`sequence_animation`) — flattens an animation's branching frame
  graph into a linear, timed `AnimationSequence`, with deterministic (injectable) branch
  RNG, loop detection, and runaway-loop guards; plus `sequence_exit` for return-to-neutral.
- **Player** — drives a sequence against a monotonic clock, handling looping and
  completion; ask it which frame is on screen at time *t*.
- **Character** — name/state → animation resolution (case-insensitive) over a parsed
  file, incl. the multi-part gesture convention (`full_gesture` chains a gesture's base +
  `…Continued` + `…Return` parts).
- **IdleDirector** — escalating auto-idle animation selection (`IDLINGLEVEL1→2→3`).
- **Speech-text parser** (`parse_speech`) — splits a `Speak` string into balloon display
  words and a neutral speech-directive stream (all 23 tags, `\Map` dual text, `\Mrk`
  bookmarks, `\\`/`\"` escaping).

Not yet: action queue, idle escalation, move interpolation.

## Try it

Character files are third-party; drop your own into `assets/agents/` (see
`assets/README.md`). Then:

```sh
cargo test
cargo run -p crustagent-format --example dump     -- assets/agents/Merlin.acs
cargo run -p crustagent-format --example render   -- assets/agents/Merlin.acs Greet 0   # one frame -> PNG
cargo run -p crustagent-core   --example sequence -- assets/agents/Merlin.acs Greet     # print the timeline
cargo run -p crustagent-core   --example gif      -- assets/agents/Merlin.acs GetAttention  # gesture -> GIF

# See it on your desktop (transparent, always-on-top):
cargo run -p crustagent-render -- assets/agents/Merlin.acs                  # idles
cargo run -p crustagent-render -- assets/agents/Merlin.acs --say            # ...and audible (macOS `say`)
cargo run -p crustagent-render -- assets/agents/Merlin.acs GetAttention     # loop a specific gesture
```

With no animation named, the character **idles** — escalating `IDLINGLEVEL` animations,
like the assistant standing around. Name one to loop that gesture instead. **Drag** the
character with the left mouse button; **right-click** for a command menu; **Esc/Q** quits.

The window is a borderless, transparent, always-on-top `wgpu` surface (premultiplied
alpha) so the character floats on the desktop.
